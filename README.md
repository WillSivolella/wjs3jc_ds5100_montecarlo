# Montecarlo
The Montecarlo package provides three classes: Die, Game, and Analyzer, which allow you to simulate dice rolls, play dice games, and analyze the results.

## Die Class
The Die class is used to create dice objects with specific sides and weights. Each side of the die can have a different weight, determining the likelihood of it being rolled.

## Game Class
The Game class allows you to simulate playing a game with multiple dice objects. It takes a list of Die objects and simulates rolling them a specified number of times.

## Analyzer Class
The Analyzer class helps you analyze the results of a game played with the Game class. It provides methods to calculate various statistical properties of the game results.
